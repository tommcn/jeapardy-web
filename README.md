# Super Jeopardy

An online version of the famous gameshow Jeopardy!
For now it is used as a board for the host to make a board then click on tiles to expose their questions.

It is available at https://super-jeopardy.herokuapp.com/

It also has a built in builder for the boards with the ability to put custom points and questions and save the boards as a json file on your computer that you can then load into the play tab.
